These are my notes

A complete series of steps that solves a particular problem is an algorithm.

Characteristics

    Algorithms have 2 complexities.
        Memory and Time.
            How much memory does it require?
            How much time does it require to complete the problem?
            It is about these two questions.

    Typically have a defined set of input and output values

    Classification

        serial/ parallel, Some algorithms work on their data sets in sequential fashion which means they are serial in nature. A parallel algorithm can break down a data structure into smaller pieces and work on each simultenously

        exact/ approximate, It can be exact in which it produces a known predictable value or approximate in that it might or might not be exact.

        deterministic/non-deterministic ( conditional or non-conditional statements ) it can be deterministic in that it executes each step with an exact decision or it can be non-deterministic in that it attempts to produce a solution using successive guesses which become more accurate over time.

Common Algorithms

    Search Algorithms, Sorting Algorithms, Computational Algorithms ( take one set of data and derive another set of data from it ) and Collection Algorithms.

N.B % modulo, is used to divide a number by another number then return the remainder.
